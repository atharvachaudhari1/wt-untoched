# Lanyard assets

Add these files here (download from the repo's `src/assets/lanyard` if you have them):

1. **card.glb** – 3D model of the ID card  
   - Edit at: https://modelviewer.dev/editor/

2. **lanyard.png** – Texture for the lanyard band  
   - Edit in any image editor

Until these files exist, the app may show an error; add them to avoid load failures.
